                It’s not practical to pay with cash everywhere, especially for larger purchases. Instead, having a
                bank account means that you will have access to all your funds anytime you need it, because of
                services like ATMs at every street corner, and banking apps and website available on your
                smartphone. Even if you prefer to pay by cash, you will be able to withdraw it when you need it, and
                not just carry your money around.<br>
                Cash transactions are hard to keep track of you often end up wondering where you spent the money
                and it’s very difficult to stick to a budget. However, making purchases through your bank account
                means that you will always have a record of the transaction and can always pull it up when you need
                to, through your bank passbook, SMSes from your bank, or a virtual passbook through your bank app.

                Financial tracking can help you cut costs, prepare for taxes and identify growth opportunities.
                Financial tracking is essential to managing your business because if you don’t have a clear idea of
                how much money is coming in and going out, you could end up with a shortfall when you need the money
                the most. That may prevent you from pursuing a new initiative or bringing on more staff or otherwise
                blunt your growth prospects. It could also spell your business’s demise if you can’t keep the lights
                on because your budgeting fell to the wayside.

                Financial tracking, otherwise known as expense tracking, is the process of keeping tabs on your
                income and spending, ideally on a daily basis. It’s achieved by recording receipts, invoices, and
                business expenses into some form of the accounting ledger. It goes hand in hand with budgeting and
                is a valuable way to keep tabs on your business finances. <br>
                Without financial tracking, you will have no idea of whether you are making a profit or have a loss.
                Over time, financial tracking will give you a clear idea of incoming cash and outgoing costs,
                enabling you to forecast your finances, find ways to slash costs, and identify growth opportunities

                Money plays a vital role in the life of humans. It has become more than a necessity in today’s
                world. No work is possible without the aid of money. It is not really possible for every individual
                to have a sufficient amount of money to accomplish his wishes. Thus to get the required sum of money
                he borrows money which he later pays off. This activity of borrowing money is an important feature
                of the loan.
                Loans allow for growth in the overall money supply in an economy and open up competition by lending
                to new businesses.

                Credit cards let you borrow money from a bank under the agreement that you’ll repay it by your
                bill’s due date or incur interest charges.

                The ability to buy now and pay later outmatches other forms of payment, such as debit cards or cash,
                which both require you to have the money available for payment at the time of purchase. In addition
                to having more flexibility with payments, credit cards help you to establish a credit score so you
                can qualify for other financial products, such as loans and mortgages.

                There also can be some monetary perks to having a credit card, where cardholders can earn rewards on
                every purchase, which can be later cashed in for travel, statement credits and more. Some credit
                cards also offer intro interest-free periods.
